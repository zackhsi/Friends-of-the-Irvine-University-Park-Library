          <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
          The Friends of the Library is dedicated to financially helping the University Park public library. We raise our money by running the Friends of the Library bookstore which sells books, books on tape and CD, CDs, DVDs, games, puzzles, etc. that are generously donated by the community.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p><small>The University Park Friends of the Library in Irvine, California, was founded in 1975. As of 2012, it has donated $1.25 million to the University Park public library, including $0.7 million in the last decade. The bookstore itself has existed for 30 years, and continues giving back to the community. The Friends of the Library stocks a wide range of books, from comic books to rare intellectual books, as well as large collections of books in many foreign languages.

          <h3>What We've Done</h3>
          <p><small>We spearheaded the campaign for a much-needed renovation of the University Park public library, which was completed in December 2009. In addition, we have generously donated to the children's programs of libraries in the surrounding area. Our extensive and quality books have attracted buyers beyond Irvine to as far as Carlsbad in San Diego County and Lake Arrowhead in San Bernardino County.
